# kismetdb2kml
Python GUI to generate KML files of device locations from KismetDB files.

## Better Alternative?
Kismet nowadays provides its own KML generation script with more features than this script. [Read more here](https://www.kismetwireless.net/docs/readme/kismetdb/kismetdb_kml/)

## Background
This was part of small projects to learn how to develop Tk GUIs on Windows.

If needed to run in a single exe, it can easily be packaged with [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).
